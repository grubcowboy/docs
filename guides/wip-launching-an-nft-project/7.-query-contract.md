# 7. Query contract

You can query the current state of your contract to verify if everything worked. The easiest way to do this is via the REPL.&#x20;

If you have properly set your sg721 contract address in the config file, you can load and query it from the REPL using:

```
yarn query
```

On startup, you should see the number of tokens minted. After that you can query the contract. For example, to get the NFT info for token ID 1, run:

```
account balance: { denom: 'ustars', amount: '3800000000' }
num tokens: { count: 3 }

client.queryContractSmart(sg721, { nft_info: { token_id: "1" } });
{
  token_uri: 'ipfs://bafybeieousyzgrlt6xyn75dkxrmhy5ynje2kmft3qmavgihylenn4slycm/1',
  extension: {}
}
```

You can find the full list of queries in the base [contract code](https://github.com/public-awesome/cw-nfts/blob/main/contracts/cw721-base/src/msg.rs#L76).
