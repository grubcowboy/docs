# 7. Query contract

You can query the current state of your contract to verify if everything worked. The easiest way to do this is via the REPL.&#x20;

For example, to query the number of tokens in your NFT contract, first load the your NFT contract.

```
yarn run load
```

Now you can perform the query in the REPL:

```
const res = await client.queryContractSmart(contract, NumTokens {});
console.log(res);
```
