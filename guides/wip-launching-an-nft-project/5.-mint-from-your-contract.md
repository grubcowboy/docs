# 6. Mint from your contract

After instantiating your contract in Step 4, it's now possible to mint NFTs from the contract. If you have not already done so, make sure to replace `minter` in `config.js` with the address of your minter contract from the previous step.

There are various minting options. You can mint for yourself, to someone's address, or mint a specific NFT to someone's address. You can also mint a batch of NFTs at a time.

### Mint a specific NFT for an address

You can mint a specific NFT by its token ID to a specific address as well.

```
yarn run mint --for [tokenId] [address]
```

{% hint style="info" %}
This command can be used to airdrop tokens before minting starts. There's no fee when run by the contract admin.
{% endhint %}

### Mint to an address

{% hint style="info" %}
NOTE: This command mints the next available `tokenId` to a given address. DO NOT run this until all tokens for specific address have been minted using `mint --for` above.
{% endhint %}

Mint to a specific address.

```
yarn run mint --to [address]
```

Simply repeat the above for every address you want to mint an NFT to. The next sequential token ID will be used for each mint call. This command also has no fee for the contract admin.

### Batch Mint

Finally you can mint a batch of NFTs at a time.

```
yarn run batch-mint [num]

// i.e: yarn run mint --batch 5
// batch mint 5 NFTs sequentially
```
