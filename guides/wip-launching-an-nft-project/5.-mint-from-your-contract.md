# 5. Mint from your contract

After instantiating your contract in Step 4, it's now possible to mint NFTs from the contract. If you have not already done so, make sure to replace `minter` in `config.js` with the address of your minter contract from the previous step.

There are various minting options. You can mint for yourself, to someone's address, or mint a specific NFT to someone's address. You can also mint a batch of NFTs at a time.

### Mint to an address

Mint to a specific address.

```
yarn run mint --to [address]
```

Simply repeat the above for every address you want to mint an NFT for. The next sequential token ID will be used for each mint call.&#x20;

### Mint a specific NFT to an address

You can mint a specific NFT by its token ID to a specific address as well.

```
yarn run mint --for [tokenId] [address]
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Both `mint` `--too` and `--for` can be used to airdrop tokens before minting starts. There's no fee when the contract admin runs these commands.
{% endhint %}

### Batch Mint

Finally you can mint a batch of NFTs at a time.

```
yarn run mint --batch [num]

// i.e: yarn run mint --batch 5
// batch mint 5 NFTs sequentially
```
