# 4. Instantiate minter contract on testnet

On Stargaze, you can instantiate contract code that has already been uploaded to the chain. You don't need to deploy new contracts like you have to do on Ethereum.

Since NFT minter and collection (sg721) contracts already exist on Stargaze, you can just make new instances of them.

The following command will instantiate two contracts:

* **minter**: This contract contains all the logic for minting, managing prices and whitelists.
* **sg721**: This contract is your NFT collection contract that contains the list of all NFTs with associations to owners and metadata.

```
yarn run init
```

If all went well, you should see a print out of your minter contract address and sg721 contract address.&#x20;

```
  attributes: [
    {
      key: '_contract_address',
      value: 'stars1vauk4puffxad4r3qs3ex0vfl5mkuw5xeuxuq5y93kta8r7lfkfksgehgkv'
    },
    { key: 'action', value: 'instantiate_minter' },
    {
      key: '_contract_address',
      value: 'stars1nwp0ynjv84wxysf2f5ctvysl6dpm8ngm70hss6jeqt8q7e7u345snh8c0u'
    },
    { key: 'action', value: 'instantiate_sg721' }
  ]
```

Edit `config.js` and fill in the minter address above for `minter`. It will be used in the next section to mint from your contract.

Congratulations! You have completed the first step in launching your collection.

In the next section you'll learn various ways to mint NFTs from your minter contract.
