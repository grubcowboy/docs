# 4. Create a whitelist (optional)

A whitelist is a list of addresses that are allowed to mint before public minting starts.

In order to create a whitelist, you have to instantiate a whitelist contract and associate it with your minter.

### Instantiate a whitelist contract

First, edit `config.js` and fill in whitelist addresses in `whitelist`, and add the times you want the whitelist to start and end.

If you don't have all addresses for the whitelist right now, don't worry as you can always add more later.

{% hint style="info" %}
Whitelist creation has a 100 STARS network free. 50% of this fee is burned, while the other half is sent to the Community Pool. In the future, this half will be distributed to Stargaze stakers.
{% endhint %}

Instantiate a whitelist contract with:

```
yarn run whitelist
```

Make of note of the contract address in the output of the above command. Edit `config.js` and use this address for `whitelistContract`.&#x20;



### Unit Price and Per Address Limit

You can set a different price and per address limit for the duration of the whitelist period, edit `config.js` and set the fields accordingly.&#x20;

### Add to whitelist

You can always add more addresses to the whitelist with:

```
yarn run whitelist --add 'address1,address2,address3,...'
```

### Show whitelist configuration

```
yarn run whitelist --show-config
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The whitelist can have a maximum of 5,000 addresses.
{% endhint %}
