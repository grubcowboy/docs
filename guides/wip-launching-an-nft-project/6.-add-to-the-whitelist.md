# 6. Create a whitelist

A whitelist is a list of addresses that are allowed to mint before public minting starts.

In order to create a whitelist, you have to instantiate a whitelist contract and associate it with your minter.

### Instantiate a whitelist contract

First, edit `config.js` and fill in whitelist addresses in `whitelist`, and add the time you want the whitelist to end by editing `whitelistEndTime`.

If you don't have all addresses for the whitelist right now, don't worry as you can always add more later.

Instantiate a whitelist contract with:

```
yarn run whitelist
```

Make of note of the contract address in the output of the above command. Edit `config.js` and use this address for `whitelistContract`.&#x20;

### Add to whitelist

You can always add more addresses to the whitelist with:

```
yarn run whitelist --add 'address1,address2,address3,...'
```
