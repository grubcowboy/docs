# 8. Launching on mainnet with Keplr

{% hint style="info" %}
Make sure you have properly tested launching your collection on testnet before launching it on mainnet. Only successful testnet launches will be featured on stargaze.zone.
{% endhint %}

For creators uncomfortable with using Stargaze Tools with their mnemonic / seed phrase on their local computers can use the Stargaze website to launch collections and sign transactions using [Keplr](https://www.keplr.app).

Navigate to [https://stargaze.zone/tx](https://stargaze.zone/tx) and submit the JSON output of the commands from the previous steps.

For example, to launch a collection, paste the JSON output of the `yarn minter` command into the box for **Instantiate a Minter with SG-721** and hit the **Submit** button. You'll be prompted to sign and broadcast via Keplr.

If you have Keplr setup to work with a Ledger device, you'll be prompted to sign with Ledger.
{% endhint %}

To execute transactions that don't involve instantiating a new contract, use the **Execute a transaction** form at the bottom. This can be used for minting commands, and adding to the whitelist. Be sure to fill in the correct amount for any funds that have to be sent along with your transaction, or leave the **Amount** field empty if none is required.
