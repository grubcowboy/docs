# 9. Deploy on mainnet

You have thoroughly tested your contracts on testnet. You need to change some of the values in `config.js` before deploying to mainnet.&#x20;

* change rpc to mainnet rpc `rpcEndpoint: 'https://rpc.stargaze-apis.com/',`
* change `startTime` of the launch. Ex: 3pm EST on Friday, March 25, 2022, format it to UTC: `startTime: '2022-03-25T19:00:00.000Z',`
* change account to your mainnet account

Now you're ready to deploy. At any time, before whitelist, during whitelist sale, or during public sale you are able to use `mint_to(address)` or `mint_for(token_id, address)` to do airdrops. If the special airdrop tokens are  early token ids (ex: 1, 2, 3, etc), then you want to deploy your contract early and give yourself enough time to run the airdrop and check the results.

Congratulations! You are officially a Stargaze Creator!
